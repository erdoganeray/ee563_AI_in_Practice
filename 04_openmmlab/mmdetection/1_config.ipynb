    "MMDetection and other OpenMMLab repositories use [MMEngine’s config system](https://mmengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_tutorials/config.html). It has a modular and inheritance design, which is convenient to conduct various experiments.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   ``{model component names}``: Names of the components used in the algorithm such as backbone, neck, etc. For example, ``r50-caffe_fpn_gn-head`` means using caffe-style ResNet50, FPN and detection head with Group Norm in the algorithm.\n",

    "    *   ``{schedule}``: training schedule, options are ``1x``, ``2x``, ``20e``, etc. ``1x`` and ``2x`` means 12 epochs and 24 epochs respectively. ``20e`` is adopted in cascade models, which denotes 20 epochs. For ``1x``/``2x``, the initial learning rate decays by a factor of 10 at the 8/16th and 11/22th epochs.
